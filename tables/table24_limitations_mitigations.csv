Limitation,Mitigation
Finite record effects (periodogram/ACF),Longer duration; multiple seeds; average spectra
Timer resolution / MCU jitter,Timer/ISR; keep ISR short; stable clock
Compliance saturation (high R or long PW),Use Fig. 23; reduce PW or Î»; increase V_comp within safety
EMC emissions from fast edges,Series R / RC snubber; careful layout; shielding
PW quantization at short widths,Calibrate; set PW_min; characterize error
