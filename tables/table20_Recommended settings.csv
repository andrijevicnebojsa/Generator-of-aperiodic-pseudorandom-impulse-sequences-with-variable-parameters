Parameter,Recommendation,Rationale
Pulse form,"Biphasic, charge-balanced (cathodic-first), inter-phase gap 25–100 µs","Avoid net DC; reduce electrode polarization [13,14]"
Current amplitude (,"0.5–5 mA (bench), start low and step","Within open-source stimulator ranges [13,14]"
?),,
PW per phase,100–500 µs,Common for peripheral stimulation [11–14]
Rate (? or PRF),1–5 Hz,"Aperiodic timing reduces adaptation [11,12]"
Aperiodic timing,Poisson-like (Exp ISI) with logging,"Memoriless intervals mitigate anticipation [11,12]"
Compliance margin,10–20% below ,"Headroom vs. impedance drift [25,26]"
,,
Isolation & CCS,Opto + CCS with limit & monitoring,"Safety boundary & current control [25–28,31,32]"
